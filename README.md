# End-to-End Car Steering Angle prediction using Vision Transformers
Self driving cars are getting better everyday. Deep learning gives a leverage to use only camera/visual input for driving cars instead of relying on expensive additional equipment/sensors like LiDar, Depth sensors etc. Vision Transformers can perform much better than CNNs given the right use case and ample data. This project is based on the paper : https://journal.binus.ac.id/index.php/commit/article/view/8425
